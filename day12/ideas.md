# Ideas

## Part 1

- Backtracking
- Keep track of `#` count to prune branches more quickly

## Part 2

- Lots of repetition
- Divide & conquer
- Can we split at dot boundaries and consider independent subproblems?
  - Note: We have "annoying" input without fixed dots (e.g. `???#?????????`), so this will probably not work
