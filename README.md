# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in 25 different programming languages.

- [ ] Day 01: [C](day01/src/day01.c)

## Scripts

The programs are packaged with Nix. By abstracting over languages' compilers, interpreters and build tools in an elegant, declarative way, CI can use a single workflow across all programs.

## Previous years
