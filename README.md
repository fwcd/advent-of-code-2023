# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in 25 different programming languages.

- [ ] Day 01: [C](day01/src/day01.c)

## Scripts

Each day includes a `shell.nix` that sets up the corresponding language's compiler or interpreter.

This standardized pattern lets CI use a single workflow (per OS) across all days. Additionally, they make it easy to get started developing locally even across the range of different languages, build tools and package managers involved.

## Previous years
