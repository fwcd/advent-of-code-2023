# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in 25 different programming languages.

- [x] Day 01: [C](day01/src/day01.c)
- [x] Day 02: [COBOL](day02/src/day02.cob)
- [x] Day 03: [ALGOL 60](day03/src/day03.alg)
- [x] Day 04: [Nix](day04/src/day04.nix)
- [ ] Day 05: [B](day05/src/day05.b) ([readme](day05/README.md))

## Packaging

The programs are packaged with Nix, making it easy for CI to run a single workflow over all days regardless of the compiler/language used.
